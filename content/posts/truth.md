In this blog post, I want to put out thoughts on the topic of truth. More specifically, I want to look at how the modern understanding of truth as a rhetorical tool, rather than something that is practical in our everyday life. My motivation for writing this is to get my thought out on paper, as well as to express my disagreements with Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson on this specific topic.

## Disclaimer

As I hopefully will make clear further on in the blog post, this is only my personal opinions on the topic, and I might be lacking nuance and insights on many of my points. Additionally, I am not trying to expose or completely negate all the points Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Peterson are arguing for, but I will propose a different way of approaching truth than these two present.

## The Current Problem on Truth

The main problem I find with figures appealing to truth nowadays is that they seem to push forward their political agenda, which diminishes the importance of truth being simple and easy to understand. Mr. Shapiro for example appeals to _facts and logic_, to portray himself as so-called ‚Äúdestroying‚Äù libtards and others of the kind. He calls out these so-called libtards for not knowing truth from falsehood, while saying that himself and his followers knows the truth. But in doing so, he mystifies the practical bearings of the usage of truth, instead making it, as he says it ‚Äúhard and based in facts‚Äù. By not addressing what he specifically means by truth, he makes the term ambiguous and hard to understand for a bystander, such as myself.

Mr. Peterson also appeals to truth, though not to the same extent as Mr. Shapiro. Mr. Peterson sees truth as a necessary element of being virtuously good. He talks of truth as something that makes life more bearable than if you were to lie all the time. I kind of get Mr. Petersons first point here. Being virtuous and truthful are, in a normative sense, necessary. However, it doesn‚Äôt seem to me that truth has anything to do with making things _bearable_. Including that, Mr. Peterson talks about truth as something being present in our collective consciousness. This is transcendental view of truth is ambigous, moslty because of the term ‚Äúcollective consciousness‚Äù, which for me is extremely problematic. For: what constitues consciousness at all? I don't see how it can be reduced to the chemical build-up, because this seems too simplistic a model to describe the totality of human experience, and how _it_ relates to truth.

For me, truth is something different. It‚Äôs not a statement about something in ‚Äúreality‚Äù [^1]. Rather than that, truth can be understood as a modus of how something can be in in the world. It's a process, in which sed truth cannot be understood independent of the agent‚Äôs way of evaluating it. The agent, under such circumstances, can‚Äôt be abstracted from his or her environment when evaluating something to be true or false. Something is true given the right practical context, and it can‚Äôt be completely independent from human experience. It‚Äôs not beyond us, because it‚Äôs a rational evaluation of some state of affairs.

The main problem I find with so called _truthsayers_, such as Mr. Peterson and Mr. Shapiro, is that of its use as a rhetorical means. It‚Äôs not seen as something we use just to explicate something as being true, rather it‚Äôs used as something hard and ‚Äúreal‚Äù, that some people posess, and others don‚Äôt. To me, this has practical implications in numerous ways, but I can‚Äôt go into too much details here. I will however look at why this approach to truth is problematic.

If you use truth only as a power tool to appeal to a certain audience, all your achieving is polarization, instead of trying to understand the others perspective; finding common ground and being sincere with one another, instead of being at each other‚Äôs throats. It‚Äôs only when you start to understand what people agree upon ‚Äì beyond their political convictions ‚Äì that you‚Äôll understand the practical bearings of truth. It isn‚Äôt something to be found, it has always been there in our language. It‚Äôs not some non-verbal entity, rather _it is_ an integral part of how we converse.

Of course, I not with this dismissing undeniable proof about how the world was before humans came to talk and experience it, viz. the Big Bang. However, one cannot understand something about the world without the use of language. The world, experience and language are knitted into a large melting pot of the key elements that constitutes our cognitive knowledge. But truth is nothing more than what linguistic users agree upon when trying to discuss sed experience, or sed world. It doesn‚Äôt correspond to anything ‚Äúreal‚Äù, in the traditional understanding of the term [^2]

With all that has been said, I hope you‚Äôll be inclined to take a step back from the on-going debates that are made to radicalize us, viz. the debates led by extremist groups. My intent is not to portray Mr. Shapiro or Mr. Peterson as representatives for extremist groups. By all means, people are entitled to associate with whoever they agree with. However, I see it as necessary to take a step back from what Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Peterson are trying to appeal to in a political sense, and think critically about their understanding of abstract concepts, such as truth.

[^1]: The reason I put ‚Äúreality‚Äù in parentheses, is because I see it as imperative that we abandoned the term, in hopes we finds something better suited. Instead of understanding it as something separate and independent of us, I would like to purpose that it‚Äôs rather co-dependent on the organism enacting in it. Reality thus, as I see it, is created in our interactions with other beings in the world, and is a term we use to cope with our surroundings. It‚Äôs useful to say something is a part of reality because it helps us paint our playing-field for what possibilities we must work with within our world, from a cognitive point of view. However, if the term is used unconsciously, it only leads to more confusion and ambiguity. Therefore, with this, I hope I‚Äôve made my point clear that I will _not_ be using the term reality in the traditional sense of the word.
[^2]: This view is primary fueled by Descartes distinction between what‚Äôs internal, that being _res cogito_, and what‚Äôs external, _res extensa_, of the subject. What‚Äôs is real is in this picture is that some ideas can _correspond_ to the external world better than others. I simply deny this view and move on.
