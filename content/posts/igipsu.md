I finally got a definite indication: I got into Cognitive Science program at the University of Bergen! I am excited about what this entails, and especially to see what Bergen is like. I have used the past week (I found out that I got in only 4-5 days ago) to do some research on how my following semesters are structured, as well as to register and pay the student fee for it.

I hope it lives up the hype, it is after all the only place in Norway you can get this kind of experience.

The trip down there is going to be a drag, for its 9h 30m ish... However, this means I get to spend some quality time with my dad, as well as dusting off my driving skills.

Anyways, other than school, I have now recovered fully from the jetlag I acquired while traveling to the US. It took about 6-8 days for my sleep schedule to get back to normal, although I still tend to have some sleepless nights (this is not unusual for me though, for it was a problem before the trip also.)

There is a lot I could say about the trip, but for the sake of my own privacy as well as those I traveled with, I am going to withstand the urge to post it here.

When it comes to this blog post space, I must find a better way to write these markdown files. I am currently writing them directly in the GitHub web GUI, and it has neither auto-correction nor auto-syntax functions. It would be much appreciated if I got some recommendations. I only got one criterion for this app: It must be available on both Windows and Linux.

I will continue to keep this blog updated as the semester starts, and we start doing cool projects :-)
