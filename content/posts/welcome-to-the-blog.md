It's about time for me to start blogging! I've been putting off the idea for quite some time now (Just wanted everything else on the site to be in order first), but I'm finally doing it.

I'll for the most part make blog posts on things that interested me, be that philosophy, technology, or whatever. I will also be posting updates to the site when I see that as necessary.

As of now, I can tease what I'll be working on with regards to the website, as well as some ideas for blog topics:

1. Creating a page with the books I own, categorized in alphabetical order, genre and which ones I've read.
2. Creating more donation options (as of writing this I only accept `Paypal` unfortunately). Here, I am going to add the option to donate in `Monero` and through the Norwegian payment service `Vipps`.
3. I am currently reading Friedrich Nietzsche's collected works, and I have considered going in-depth in at least one of them. Specifically, *GÃ¶tzen-DÃ¤mmerung* (1889) (Twilight of the Idols). 
4. Setting my own mail server, so I am able to receive mails with `gpg` keypair. It's never gonna be as good as anonymous messaging services, but end-to-end encryption is fine for my use of communication. (This is on the back burner).

That's all for now, remember to subscribe to my RSS feed. You can access it through the main page on this website, or by clicking [here](https://www.jonasskanoy.xyz/posts/index.xml).

PS. Happy 4th of July to any American reading this!
