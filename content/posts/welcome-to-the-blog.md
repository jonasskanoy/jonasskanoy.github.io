It's about time for me to start blogging! I've been putting off the idea for quite some time now (Just wanted everything else on the site to be in order first), but I'm finally doing it.

I'll for the most part make blog posts on things that interested me, be that philosophy, technology, or whatever. I will also be posting updates to the site when I see that as necessary.

That's all for now, remember to subscribe to my RSS feed. You can access it through the main page on this website, or by clicking [here](https://www.jonasskanoy.xyz/posts/index.xml).

PS. Happy 4th of July to any American reading this!
