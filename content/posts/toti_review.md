In this post, I will review Nietzsche‚Äôs famous work _G√∂tzen-D√§mmerung_, also known as ‚ÄúTwilight of the Idols.‚Äù I will try conveying the thoughts I found most fruitful from each of the chapters.  

## Disclosure 
This work might be one of Nietzsche‚Äôs least nuanced works, and many of the stands he takes can be questioned because of his declining health. This is the third to last book before his breakdown in 1889, the last two being _the Antichrist_ and _Ecce homo_. However, this possibility of health declination is not an argument to devalue all of Nietzsche's points in this book as a product of a madman. Rather, it gives us some interesting perspectives into Nietzsche‚Äôs evolving thought through his philosophical writings. 

## The title 
All great authors spend considerable time choosing the title for their works, so I will respect this effort with attending to the book title. To get a better sense of what the title in English tells us, we must look at the composition of the German title. Other than possibly being inspired by Richard Wagner‚Äôs opera _G√∂tterd√§mmerung_, the German for word _G√∂tze_ is quite interesting. It might be translated to something like ‚Äòfalse gods,‚Äô or ‚Äòidol,‚Äô a person that is praised and devoted for their thoughts or actions. ‚ÄúWho are these false gods?‚Äù you might ask. As I have understood it: all great post-Socratic philosophers of Western philosophy; from Socrates, all the way to Schopenhauer. I will come back to what specifically Nietzsche thought about these philosophers, and why he thought philosophy has inherited a so-called _decadent_[^1] tradition that spans all the way back to Greek antiquity. 

The subtitle is also worth considering because it says something about the metaphorical hammer method Nietzsche will use. ‚ÄúHow to Philosophize with a Hammer‚Äù shows how Nietzsche‚Äôs methodology is going to be radically different to that of his philosophical predecessors. Nietzsche is on a mission to destroy nearly all of western philosophy leading up to his time, and obliterate the arguments that the great western philosophers before him relied on to justify their metaphysical doctrines. As I understand, he hoped this method would reveal the biases that had remained unquestioned and natural. This method would thus open for Nietzsche to anew and establishing a groundwork for a ‚Äúphilosophy of the future;‚Äù a philosophy based on reevaluating our values in such a way that they serve life. 

  

## The problem of Socrates 
In this chapter, Nietzsche attacks Socrates for the changes he made in Greek society. Shifting the focus from here-and-now, Nietzsche's Socrates makes death a noble and virtuous act, which will be rewarded for in the afterlife. This turn away from the material world to a reality beyond it is described by Nietzsche as the _consensus sapientium_ (The agreement of the wise); an agreement that has made the tradition of western philosophy sick. This disease has according to Nietzsche yet to be cured and has shaped the thoughts of famous philosophers, such as Kant, Schopenhauer, Spinoza, and Descartes. 

Nietzsche blames Socrates for the shift from will to dialectics. The dialectics are according to Nietzsche, a tool by the weak, for the weak. Those who do not have any other tools at their disposal, like physical might or power, will try to _convince_ others why their argument is the correct way of viewing things. However, as Nietzsche puts it, Socrates‚Äô _will to truth_ through dialects, is just a derived way of exerting a will to power; a more cunning way to excess it, compared to those who can do it without the struggle of arguing and discussing. 

As Greek society lost their ethical and aesthetical ways, it became ready for a new set of value, which happened to be those of Socrates. Reason thus became favored over instinct, virtue over sin, etc. All of these intellectual properties were to be set as equal to the level of happiness one possessed. The lack of exerting one's power, meant that man had to exert it inward, thus the decadence of the Greek society began, and it became a _weak_ society. 

To put it very briefly, Nietzsche did not have a problem with Socrates _per se_, but rather the decadent nature of the philosophical tradition that derived from him. Life according to Nietzsche would be enjoyed in a greater way without these unnecessary annoyances and questioning. 

## How the real world became a fable 

In this passage, Nietzsche recaps the history of philosophy in the past 2300 years in six points. He starts off with Plato‚Äôs thought of the true world being in the world of forms, beyond our material reality. Thus, Plato makes the shift away from the senses, and claims that the essence of truth exists in a reality inaccessible to it (the senses). 

Next, Christianity comes along and says that this world beyond is a place that is promised us by God, if one acts according to his rule. With this, the material world for a Christian is only a _preparation_ for the afterlife. The here-and-now is only a trial. Our values are thus placed a step further away from our senses. 

After this, the German philosopher Immanuel Kant introduces the _Ding an sich_ (thing-in-itself). According to Kant, we can only know the world as it is mediated through us, which makes it impossible to view the world beyond our rational faculties. This means that true metaphysical knowledge of the world remains inaccessible to us. 

In the fourth point, Nietzsche points out that because of Kants conclusion of the thing-in-itself, we no longer have a need to formulate some beyond world because it is inaccessible to us. This can thus be a starting point of turning our focus back to the material world. Through the development brought to us by science and logic, we can find good enough answers to our phenomena. 

There is however one question left unanswered: if we have resolved the need for a beyond world, where does that leave the material world? This is according to Nietzsche where we stand today. With the possibility of a world beyond destroyed, consequently all values must be reevaluated. From here on out, our values will have to take place in the material, a task for the _free spirits_, as Nietzsche would call them. 

## What I owe to the Ancients 

Nietzsche seems in this passage to state that he has so-called ‚Äúunpopular opinions‚Äù when it comes to his dislikes of Greek antiquity. As mentioned earlier, he does not like the thoughts or the writing style of Plato and sees it as a deceptive way of using dialectics to exert power. By making this world of forms, Plato bases his arguments on an abstract reality beyond the senses, which he uses to justify his own belief that the here-and-now is nothing but a mere _imitation_, the only reality that can derive truth is the ideal one. 

However, he finds that Greek culture before Plato and Socrates was a higher form of being, and that the ideal lays in this past historical event. This culture exerted their _will to power_ through honoring their rivalry with the Spartans and barbarians, not based on some abstract truth, but rather out of the need to praise the nature of having rivals. With a rival, the exertion of the will to power becomes a joyful act, one feels alive; one gets a feeling of overcoming oneself _through_ the rival. 

The Dionysian / Apollonian distinction is for Nietzsche particularly important to understand the Greeks. According to Nietzsche, the Greek tragedy incapsulates the key to the Greek spirit. It showed how overcoming our emotions, such as suffering and pain, allows us to live in accordance with ourselves. Tragedy is not, as Aristotle thought, a cleansing of pain and suffering. Rather, it is a way of being that indulges itself in the suffering, embraces it, and transcends it. 

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, this book is one of my favorite works by Nietzsche, mainly because of the free-spirited thoughts he lays out in it. He puts forward some insightful thoughts about the decadent nature of western philosophy, that can be traced all the way down to the roots of western philosophy ‚Äì that being Plato and Socrates. I am not going to defend all stands he makes in this book, such as his insistence on killing undesirables in society, such as handicapped and mentally challenged (Nietzsche, _Raids of an Untimely Man_, ¬ß36). However, I do think the book is worth a read, as it gives a good grasp of Nietzsche's life affirming philosophy. 

[^1]: Decadence is a French term, meaning decay or degeneration. Nietzsche uses it in this work to illustrate the cultural decay of Greek society, because of philosophers like Plato and Socrates.
