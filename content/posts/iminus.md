Long time no seen, it feels good to be back blogging!

I am currently on summer vacation in the US, more specifically the Westcoast of Florida. We drove all the way down from NYC, which took us about one week, mostly because of sightseeing and the fact that we took our time.

I have seen so much this past week and thought it would be cool to at least give whoever is reading this a glimpse into how the vacation is going :-).

So, as I was saying, we started in NYC. We were there for a couple of days, saw some cool stuff viz. Ground Zero, Central Park, The Edge (where the picture on the right was shot!). After our stay there was over, we rented two large SUVs, which we have been driving all the way down to where we are now. On the way here we got a little taste of the Blueridge Mountains, which gave us quite the contrast to the urban settlements we visited, viz. NYC, DC, Savannah, and Asheville, etc.

When we finally came down to where we are currently staying, we spent our time close to the house we are renting. It is quite strange how American households have everything on one floor, but it is indeed practical to get around the house because of it.

I am currently, as of writing this, in what looks like a twin bedroom. It is coupled with two single beds and a spinning fan that is triggering small epilepsy (nothing serious though.). The curtains in this room are conspicuous, in that they are quite old (not like retro-old, more like 70s-80s old. Not exactly aesthetically pleasing.), with their red stripes, that cut into each other.

Other than that, I finished my bachelor's degree in philosophy! I am so relieved that it is finally over. Although I will miss philosophy, there is a difference between working as a philosopher, and being interested in philosophy, and it has become apparent to me that I am in the second camp rather than the former. I do not want to kill my playful spirit when it comes to philosophy, therefore I will do my upmost to not exhaust myself and have it as side-hobby. However, I am not going to root myself in this statement, mainly because I want to hold my options open for the future; who knows, I want to continue doing philosophy in like 10-15 years? Time will show.

I am still waiting for a response from Samordna opptak on if got into Cognitive Science in Bergen. I am a bit stressed about the whole thing, mostly because I have already rented an apartment down there, so if I do not get in, I will have to pay for the first month or two (which will sting a bit lol.). Including that my family seem quite worried about the entire process. I agree that moving far away is cumbersome, but I do think it will be worth it in the end for me. The potential anxiety that comes with it is only helping me improve and get better at coping with the world in a different, and hopefully instrumental way. I am hoping for the best though, and fortunately I have some options in Trondheim if, for a lack of better words, shit hits the fan.

I think this will have to do for now. I will try my best to post if I got into Cognitive Science or not. As I have written above, I hopefully will get in, but there are no guaranties in life. I really want to skip town though, at least for a while, to get some new perspectives and impulses from some place other than living where I have been living all my life.
