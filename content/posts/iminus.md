Long time no seen, it feels good to be back blogging!

I'm currently on summer vacation in the US, more specifically the westcoast of Florida. We've been driving all the way down from NYC, which took us about one week, mostly because of sightseeing and the fact that we took our time.

I've seen so much this past week, and thought it would be cool to atleast give whoever is reading this a glimse into how the vacation is going :-).

So, as I was saying, we started in NYC. We were there for a couple of days, saw some cool stuff viz. Ground Zero, Central Park, The Edge (where the picture on the right was shot!). After our stay there was over, we rented two large SUVs, which we've been driving all the way down to where we're now. On the way here we got a little taste of the the Blueridge Mountains, which gave us quite the contrast to the urban settlements we visited, viz. NYC, DC, Savannah and Asheville, etc.

When we finally came down were we're currently staying, we've been spending our time close to the house we're renting. It's quite strange how American households have everything on one floor, but it's indeed practical to get around the house because of it.

I'm currently, as of writing this, in what looks like a twin bedroom. It's coupled with two single beds, and a spinning fan that is triggering some kind of small epilepsys (nothing serious though.). The curtains in this room are conspicuous, in that they are quite old (not like retro-old, more like 70s-80s old. Not excactly aesthetically pleasing.), with their red stripes, that cut into each other.

Other then that, I finished my bachelors degree in philosophy! So relieved that it's finally over. Although I'll miss philosophy, there's a difference between working _as_ a philosopher, and being _interested_ in philosophy, and it has become apperent to me that I'm in the second camp rather than the former. I don't want kill my playful spirit when it comes to philosophy, therefore I'll do my upmost to not exhaust myself, and rather have it as side-hobby. However, I'm not going to root myself to this statement, mainly because I want to hold my options open for the future; who knows, maybe I want to continue doing philosophy in like 10-15 years? Time will show.

I'm still waiting for a response from _Samordna opptak_ on if got into Cogntive Science in Bergen. I'm a bit stressed about the whole thing, mostly because I've already rented a apartment down there, so if I don't get in I'll most likely have to pay for the first month or two (which will sting a bit lol.). Including that my family seem quite worried about the whole process. I agree that moving far away is cumbersome, but I do think it will be worth it in the end for me. The potential anxiety that comes with it, is only helping me improve and get better at coping with the world in a different, and hopefully instrumental way. I'm hoping for the best though, and fortunately I have some options in Trondheim if, for a lack of better words, _shit hits the fan_.

I think this will have to do for now. I'll try to remember that I'll post if I got into Cognitive Science or not. As I've written above I hopefully will get in, but there are no garanties in life. I really want to skip town though, atleast for a while, to get some new perspectives and impulses from some place other than where I've been living all my life.
