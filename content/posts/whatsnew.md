This semester is going to be my final one as a bachelor student in philosophy! Am very excited to get started, and whilst what comes after is uncertain, I am very grateful for the chance I've been given to study something, simply because I like the subject. I am grateful for having a stable and safe family dynamic, who I can rely on both emotionally, but also with regards to practical manners. They have been supportive in my decisions from day one, and have been a huge help for me in the process througwards my own future.

With regards to creating my own path, both educationally, but also personally, I've been thinking of a talk I attended a couple of days ago. It took place at Studentersamfundet, and was held by Ole Einar B√∏hn. There he talked about Nietszschean critique of the education system, and how current academia as it stands today lack the so-called "forming" part of once education. This might be a strange term for my English readers, but if you consider the Norwegian words for education, it starts to make a whole lot of sense.

As B√∏hn presented it, Nietzsche distinguished between whats called ``dannelse``, which I translate to formation, and ``utdannelse``, which is what we ordinarily think of as education. This distinction is important to consider, because it raises a very significant question: what is the important part of ones academical education? Is it to form you, or is to educate you? Most would probably like to think that it is a synthesis of both. However, I find the latter one, the forming part, to be of much more significance when considering the interest of developing more fulfilled and creative students.

Being educated gets you a long way, don't get me wrong on this. But being formed as an individual through intellectual investigations? I find that much more fulfilling story than working as some lousy 9-5 job and wage-cucking all your life.

Universities, now more than ever, have stream-lined a way that works in educating their students on a particular subject, but this isn't a process the student has been involved in. Sure, he/her have decided the subject they want to attend, but they can't choose how their own path education-wise that will make *them* most fulfilled. Universities wants people to just be good at the things they specifically choose to get educated in, nothing more, nothing less. I cannot say it better than Roger Waters did in Pink Floyds: The Wall; they want you to become another brick in the wall. Do your specific thing good, and live happily with it. This is what the intellectual does. However, the intelligent person strives for something more than being a brick in the wall. They want to be an authentic version of themselves, and strive for the goals in which they created.

But I can't see how this is fulfilling, there is so much more to life than abide by what is expected by you. Our experience is contingent and finite, and could be taken away from us at any moment. So why bother doing things in life that just gets you by, when you can do stuff you're passionate about or find interesting? I find it a absurd way of being to not do something other than what's expected of you. In order to be formed, you‚Äôll have to make your own ideal, and strive for it on the basis that you want to achieve it.

I've been rambling on for too long now, but I felt I had to get this information out somewhere. Anyhow, I'm very grateful for the opportunity I've been given to do something with my life I do for myself, rather than to please the people or systems around me. One might say, with Nietzsche, that it's a part of my formation process, even though a formation process is continuously happening... (but that‚Äôs a subject for another time).

Most likely I'll apply for a bachelor in programming next semester at NTNU in Gj√∏vik, which will be exciting. I have to get out of Trondheim. This city is choking me (metaphorically speaking ofcourse), and I am in dire need of some fresh air. I need impulses from anywhere else but here, to fuel my own formation process. Who knows, maybe I'll find it fun to do something completely out of left field, like painting, or dancing? The doors are open at least, all I have to do is step through, even if uncertainty and anxiety sets in.
