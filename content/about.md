## About me
Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my website, powered by [*Hugo*](https://www.gohugo.io), and written in *GO*. Massive shoutout to [Luiz F. A. de PrÃ¡](https://github.com/luizdepra) for making this amazing theme, called [*Coder*](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder).

If you're instrested, or I've applied for a job at your workplace, consider checking out my *Curriculum Vitae*, where you can check out my accomplishments. The list under shows both a Norwegian and a English version of my CV:
