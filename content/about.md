## About me

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my website, powered by [_Hugo_](https://www.gohugo.io), and written in _GO_. Massive shoutout to [Luiz F. A. de PrÃ¡](https://github.com/luizdepra) for making this theme, called [_Coder_](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder).

If you are interested, or I have applied for a job at your workplace, consider checking out my _Curriculum Vitae_, where you can check out my accomplishments. The list under shows both a Norwegian and an English version of my CV:

My personal library is located [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/171603286?shelf=personal-library), via Goodreads.
