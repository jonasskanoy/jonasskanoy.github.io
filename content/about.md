## About me
Hi! :wave: Welcome to my website, powered by [*Hugo*](https://www.gohugo.io), and written in *GO*. Massive shoutout to [Luiz F. A. de Prá](https://github.com/luizdepra) for making this amazing theme, called [*Coder*](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder).

So, as you might tell, my name is Jonas Skånøy. I reside in Norway, and I'm currently living the life of a poor student. I get busy with both philosophy and tech, though the interest in the latter has died down over the years. Hopefully the flame of inspiration will come back with my new project to make myself a homelab server!

On another note, I'm currently studying a bachelors degree in Cognitive Science, after graduating with a bachelors degree in philosophy. Before this I worked as a apprentice at a IT-consultant company, called HEMIT.

If you're instrested, or I've applied for a job at your workplace, consider checking out my *Curriculum Vitae*, where you can check out my accomplishments. The list under shows both a Norwegian and a English version of my CV:
