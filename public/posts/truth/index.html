<p>In this blog post, I want to put out thoughts on the topic of truth. More specifically, I want to look at how the modern understanding of truth as a rhetorical tool, rather than something that is practical in our everyday life. My motivation for writing this is to get my thought out on paper, as well as to express my disagreements with Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson on this specific topic.</p>

<p>As I hopefully will make clear further on in the blog post, this is only my personal opinions on the topic, and I might be lacking nuance and insights on many of my points. Additionally, I am not trying to expose or completely negate all the points Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Peterson are arguing for, but I will propose a different way of approaching truth than these two present.</p>

  The Current Problem on Truth

<p>The main problem I find with figures appealing to truth nowadays is that they seem to push forward their political agenda, which diminishes the importance of truth being simple and easy to understand. Mr. Shapiro for example appeals to <em>facts and logic</em>, to portray himself as so-called “destroying” libtards and others of the kind. He calls out these so-called libtards for not knowing truth from falsehood, while saying that himself and his followers knows the truth. But in doing so, he mystifies the practical bearings of the usage of truth, instead making it, as he says it “hard and based in facts”. By not addressing what he specifically means by truth, he makes the term ambiguous and hard to understand for a bystander, such as myself.</p>
<p>Mr. Peterson also appeals to truth, though not to the same extent as Mr. Shapiro. Mr. Peterson sees truth as a necessary element of being virtuously good. He talks of truth as something that makes life more bearable than if you were to lie all the time. I kind of get Mr. Petersons first point here. Being virtuous and truthful are, in a normative sense, necessary. However, it doesn’t seem to me that truth has anything to do with making things <em>bearable</em>. Including that, Mr. Peterson talks about truth as something being present in our collective consciousness. This is transcendental view of truth is ambigous, moslty because of the term “collective consciousness”, which for me is extremely problematic. For: what constitues consciousness at all? I don&rsquo;t see how it can be reduced to the chemical build-up, because this seems too simplistic a model to describe the totality of human experience, and how <em>it</em> relates to truth.</p>
<p>For me, truth is something different. It’s not a statement about something in “reality” <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Rather than that, truth can be understood as a modus of how something can be in in the world. It&rsquo;s a process, in which sed truth cannot be understood independent of the agent’s way of evaluating it. The agent, under such circumstances, can’t be abstracted from his or her environment when evaluating something to be true or false. Something is true given the right practical context, and it can’t be completely independent from human experience. It’s not beyond us, because it’s a rational evaluation of some state of affairs.</p>
<p>The main problem I find with so called <em>truthsayers</em>, such as Mr. Peterson and Mr. Shapiro, is that of its use as a rhetorical means. It’s not seen as something we use just to explicate something as being true, rather it’s used as something hard and “real”, that some people posess, and others don’t. To me, this has practical implications in numerous ways, but I can’t go into too much details here. I will however look at why this approach to truth is problematic.</p>
<p>If you use truth only as a power tool to appeal to a certain audience, all your achieving is polarization, instead of trying to understand the others perspective; finding common ground and being sincere with one another, instead of being at each other’s throats. It’s only when you start to understand what people agree upon – beyond their political convictions – that you’ll understand the practical bearings of truth. It isn’t something to be found, it has always been there in our language. It’s not some non-verbal entity, rather <em>it is</em> an integral part of how we converse.</p>
<p>Of course, I not with this dismissing undeniable proof about how the world was before humans came to talk and experience it, viz. the Big Bang. However, one cannot understand something about the world without the use of language. The world, experience and language are knitted into a large melting pot of the key elements that constitutes our cognitive knowledge. But truth is nothing more than what linguistic users agree upon when trying to discuss sed experience, or sed world. It doesn’t correspond to anything “real”, in the traditional understanding of the term <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>With all that has been said, I hope you’ll be inclined to take a step back from the on-going debates that are made to radicalize us, viz. the debates led by extremist groups. My intent is not to portray Mr. Shapiro or Mr. Peterson as representatives for extremist groups. By all means, people are entitled to associate with whoever they agree with. However, I see it as necessary to take a step back from what Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Peterson are trying to appeal to in a political sense, and think critically about their understanding of abstract concepts, such as truth.</p>

<p>The reason I put “reality” in parentheses, is because I see it as imperative that we abandoned the term, in hopes we finds something better suited. Instead of understanding it as something separate and independent of us, I would like to purpose that it’s rather co-dependent on the organism enacting in it. Reality thus, as I see it, is created in our interactions with other beings in the world, and is a term we use to cope with our surroundings. It’s useful to say something is a part of reality because it helps us paint our playing-field for what possibilities we must work with within our world, from a cognitive point of view. However, if the term is used unconsciously, it only leads to more confusion and ambiguity. Therefore, with this, I hope I’ve made my point clear that I will <em>not</em> be using the term reality in the traditional sense of the word.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This view is primary fueled by Descartes distinction between what’s internal, that being <em>res cogito</em>, and what’s external, <em>res extensa</em>, of the subject. What’s is real is in this picture is that some ideas can <em>correspond</em> to the external world better than others. I simply deny this view and move on.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
