        <p>I finally got a definite indication: I got into Cognitive Science program at the University of Bergen! I&rsquo;m very excited for what this entails, and especially to see what Bergen is like. I have used the past week (I found out that I got in only 4-5 days ago) to do some research on how my following semesters are structured, as well as to register and pay the student fee for it.</p>
<p>I hope it lives up the hype, it&rsquo;s after all the only place in Norway you can get this kind of experience.</p>
<p>The trip down there is probably going to be a drag, for it&rsquo;s 9h 30m ish&hellip; However, this means I get to spend some quality time with my dad, as well as dust off my driving skills.</p>
<p>Anyways, other than school, I&rsquo;ve now recovered fully from the jet-lag I acquired while traveling to the US. It took about 6-8 days for my sleep schedule to get back to normal, although I still tend to have some sleepless nights (this is not unusual for me though, for it was a problem before the trip also.)</p>
<p>There is a lot I could say about the trip, but for the sake of my own privacy as well as those I traveled with, I&rsquo;m going to withstand the urge to post it here.</p>
<p>When it comes to this blog post space, I have to find a better way of writing these markdown files. I&rsquo;m currently writing them directly in the Github web GUI, and it has neither auto-correction nor auto-syntax functions. It would be much appreciated if I got some recommendations. I only got one criteria for this supposed app: It has to be available on both Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue to keep this blog updated as the semester starts, and we start doing cool projects :-)</p>
