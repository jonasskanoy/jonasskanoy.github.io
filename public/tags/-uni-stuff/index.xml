      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally got a definite indication: I got into Cognitive Science program at the University of Bergen! I&amp;rsquo;m very excited for what this entails, and especially to see what Bergen is like. I have used the past week (I found out that I got in only 4-5 days ago) to do some research on how my following semesters are structured, as well as to register and pay the student fee for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;figure class=&#34;right-aligned&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/edinburgh.jpg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;This was me, touching the David Hume statues toe while visting my friend in Edinburgh April last year. Had a blast of a time with the whole group who went down.&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This semester is going to be my final one as a bachelor student in philosophy! Am very excited to get started, and whilst what comes after is uncertain, I am very grateful for the chance I&amp;rsquo;ve been given to study something, simply because I like the subject. I am grateful for having a stable and safe family dynamic, who I can rely on both emotionally, but also with regards to practical manners. They have been supportive in my decisions from day one, and have been a huge help for me in the process througwards my own future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
